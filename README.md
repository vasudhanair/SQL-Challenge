# SQL-Employee-Database

This folder has a sql file of my table schemata(Schema-Table.sql), a sql file of my queries(queries.sql), 
an image file of my ERD(ERD-diagram).

## Data Modeling/Data Engineering

I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables. I used the tool [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com]
The tables were created and the CSV files were imported. Before the tables were created the following was done.

Code in the Schema-Table.sql
-- Create a departments table
-- Create an employees table
-- Create an dept_emp table 
-- Create an dept_manager table
-- Create an salaries table
-- Create an titles table

After importing the CSVs, the tables were viewed using
SELECT * FROM departments;
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM dept_emp;
SELECT * FROM dept_manager;
SELECT * FROM salaries;
SELECT * FROM titles;

### Data Analysis
Data Analysis was done and the script is saved in the queries.sql file.
